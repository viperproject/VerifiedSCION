// Goal of this file:
//   Curently, Gobra's support for resoning about the values of bitwise operations is very limited.
//   While this is not addressed, we rely on Dafny to prove that the lemmas hold, and we just provide
//   an axiomatized version of the Lemma in Gobra. This is sub-optimal, but it is less than nothing.

// How to extend:
//   When a new lemma is needed, we should prove it in this file. If the lemma
//   applies to Go's int type, we should introduce a lemma for when int has 32bit
//   and for when it has 64bit.
