// MetricVec is a Collector to bundle metrics of the same name that differ in
// their label values. MetricVec is not used directly but as a building block
// for implementations of vectors of a given metric type, like GaugeVec,
// CounterVec, SummaryVec, and HistogramVec. It is exported so that it can be
// used for custom Metric implementations.
//
// To create a FooVec for custom Metric Foo, embed a pointer to MetricVec in
// FooVec and initialize it with NewMetricVec. Implement wrappers for
// GetMetricWithLabelValues and GetMetricWith that return (Foo, error) rather
// than (Metric, error). Similarly, create a wrapper for CurryWith that returns
// (*FooVec, error) rather than (*MetricVec, error). It is recommended to also
// add the convenience methods WithLabelValues, With, and MustCurryWith, which
// panic instead of returning errors. See also the MetricVec example.
