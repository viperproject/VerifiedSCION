// goes up. That implies that it cannot be used to count items whose number can
// also go down, e.g. the number of currently running goroutines. Those
// "counters" are represented by Gauges.
//
// A Counter is typically used to count requests served, tasks completed, errors
// occurred, etc.
//
// To create Counter instances, use NewCounter.
